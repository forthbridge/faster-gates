[h1]Provides a Remix config menu for both gate opening speed and the amount of time needed to wait for gates to start opening![/h1]

[b][u]Only affects the animation itself![/u]

The time a gate takes to finish opening is still limited by how long it takes to load the destination region, however this usually takes less than a second.[/b]
